# LogisticRegression
Machine Learning using Logistic Regression

In this model, I have used the Titanic dataset from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
wherein I predict whether a person survived the Titanic crash or not based on the attributes provided.

The method used above is Logistic Regression.
